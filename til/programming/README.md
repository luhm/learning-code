# READ ME - Programming

This folder is part of my `Today I learned (TIL)` project, specifically the most important concepts and details from my programming and logic studies that I may need to remember and to rapidly access anytime in the future.

My [TIL](https://github.com/luhm/learning-code/tree/main/til) project is part of my [learning-code](https://github.com/luhm/learning-code/tree/main) studies schedule and organization.

Below you can find some interesting links on programming and logic that helps learn and practice.
