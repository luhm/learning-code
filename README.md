# learning-code

This is a repo where I share with you what I've learned while studying frontend coding. It is like to be a diary that I can (and you too!) revisited when in need to remember somethings such as best-practices, rules or else.

This will be a mix between **TIL (Today I Learned)** and **100 days {coding}**.

The TIL methodology helps me to build my documentation and the 100 days {coding} challenge helps me remember that my studies have a practical part that is necessary and that gives meaning to all theory I am studying.

## 100 days {coding}

- days 1 to 10:
  - [Link-in-bio - DevLinks](https://luhm.github.io/rocketseat-discover/)
- days 10 to 15:
  - [Recipe page](https://luhm.github.io/recipe_page_main/)
