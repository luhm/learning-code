# Learning-code

This is a repo where I share with you what I've learned while studying frontend coding. It is like to be a diary that I can (and you too!) revisited when in need to remember somethings such as best-practices, rules or else.

This will be a mix between **TIL (Today I Learned)** and **100 days {coding}**.

The TIL methodology helps me build my documentation and the 100 days {coding} challenge helps me remember that my studies have a practical part that is necessary and gives meaning to all theory I am studying. 

## TIL

- [👏 Best Practices](https://github.com/luhm/learning-code/tree/main/til/best-practices)
